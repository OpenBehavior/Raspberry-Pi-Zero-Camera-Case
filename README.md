# Raspberry-Pi-Zero-Camera-Case

Protective case for a Raspberry Pi webcam (Raspberry Pi zero + camera).

Designed by Elizabeth Glover (ejglover@uic.edu)

This was originally designed with the intention of installing the Raspberry Pi camera in a variety of animal behavioral testing environments for neuroscience research purposes. However, it can most certainly be implemented in many other scenarios, such as home surveillance or 3D printer monitoring. Some assembly is required.
